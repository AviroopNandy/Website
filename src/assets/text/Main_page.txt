Neurostimulation is the application of short electrical pulses to the surface of
the skin for the purpose of stimulating the underlying nerves and muscles. In
recent decades, neurostimulation has been used as part of a treatment called
Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) therapy to help restore mobility in the
paralyzed limb muscles of stroke victims and those who have suffered spinal cord
injuries. While carrying out research in areas such as pain reduction and
sensory feedback, scientists have also used neurostimulation to study the effect
of electrical current on neurons.

Historically, the delivery of neurostimulation has required the purchase of
expensive, research-grade equipment or the expensive, time-consuming
construction of custom hardware. NeuroStimDuino provides an open-source
alternative in the form of an Arduino shield.

### Affordable, Accessible, and Easy to Use

NeuroStimDuino was designed to help anyone with an interest in
neuroscience—students, researchers, and hobbyists alike—to study the effects of
neurostimulation on muscle contraction. It comes with an I²C interface through
which external microcontroller boards like the Arduino Due can be used to
generate different stimulation patterns and control other aspects of its
operation. Each NeuroStimDuino shield has two independent output channels, which
can be used to alternate the contraction of flexor and extensor muscles or to
contract various muscles simultaneously. By stacking multiple shields,
additional output channels can be made available.

_**Note**: A single output channel on NeuroStimDuino is capped at 20 mA, which
is sufficient to contract small muscles but insufficient to contract large ones.
Large muscles can be contracted by combining the two output channels of
NeuroStimDuinos in parallel._

### Opens the Door to Many Different Areas of Research

NeuroStimDuino is a platform technology with many possible applications. It can
be used to conduct research on how neurostimulation affects pain management and
the restoration of mobility to paralyzed extremities. It can also provide
sensory feedback to amputees and stimulate the transcutaneous vagus nerve to
study the effects of neurostimulation on depression, arthritis, and other
conditions.

## Features

- Generates biphasic, rectangular, and constant current stimulation pulses with programmable frequency, pulse-width, and amplitude
- Stimulation pulses are charge-balanced, consisting of a cathodic phase followed by an anodic phase of equal or unequal amplitudes (i.e. the waveform shape can be symmetrical or asymmetrical)
- Can be configured over I²C, from an external microcontroller acting as the controller
- Can be used as an Arduino shield, due to pin-compatibility with Arduino Due and MEGA boards
- Has two independent output channels per board. Multiple boards can be stacked to generate up to 222 channels.
- Onboard opto-isolators separate digital and analog signals
- Can be powered by a 9 V battery connected to a DC input or by an external 5 V input on VIN. For proper operation, we recommend two Li-Ion batteries (e.g. 18650s) connected in series. (Batteries not included.)
- Onboard LEDs visually indicate when neurostimulation is delivered, and a precision current-sense amplifier provides a voltage output proportional to the stimulation current.
- Includes several safety features such as fuses, an emergency OFF switch, and solid-state relays to shunt inputs with low impedance resistors
- Comes with a pair of 2 mm pin-style lead wires to connect with standard, reusable, hydrogel-based stimulation electrodes

## Technical Specifications

- Adjustable current output range:  +/- 20 mA, resolution 240 µA/step	
- Adjustable stimulation frequency range: 1 – 100 Hz, pulse-width 0 – 2 ms
- Maximum compliance voltage: +/- 60 V (uses +/- 72V High-voltage supply)
- The onboard 16-bit dsPIC33F Microcontroller (40 MIPS, 256 KB flash memory) operates as an I²C peripheral with a programmable, 7-bit address.
- Stimulation current output can be measured using the onboard 12-bit ADC or an external ADC.
- The PCB includes a microUSB interface but the components are not populated. (Upon request, we are happy to provide a list of the necessary components.) If populated, this interface can be used to control NeuroStimDuino from a PC by way of serial commands.
